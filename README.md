# KotlinCalendarExtensions
This repository consists of extension methods for the old Java Calendar API written in Kotlin, to make a developer's life much easier. They are particularly meant for Android projects that have to remain backward compatible with older Android SDK versions. These extension methods can only be used within Kotlin, calling them from vanilla Java is not possible. 

## Installation
In order to use these extension methods, just copy them within your Kotlin project.
